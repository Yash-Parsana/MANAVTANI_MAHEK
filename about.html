                <h2>Who We Are?</h2>
                <p>Helping Organisation for People, Environment and Animal Trust (MANAVTANI MAHEK PUBLIC CHARITABLE TRUST) is doing the vital work of protecting and saving urban animals from cruelty and suffering. We approach our work with energy,hope and determination every day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We use all the levers of change available for helping animals like- direct care, education,sterilisation, rescue, treatment, rehabilitation and release. Through our education programme we tried to disseminate information among the community and especially amongst children as a humane society could be made through them who are the future. Our efforts have continued in helping animals in Surat, Bharuch and Anand in Gujarat. In Surat we are continuing our efforts to keep and maintain zero human deaths due to Rabies. We have completed three years of achieving zero human deaths due to Rabies in Surat city. At Surat we have rescued, treated, rehabilitated and released thousands of animals including cats, dogs, cows, monkeys, pigs and donkeys.We have renovated new animal facility for the dogs in the holy city of Surat and in the historical city of Ahmedabad.his year, we have initiated animal welfare activities at Vadodara, Gujarat.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Mr. Raghavbhai Kalsariya, The inspiration and founder of Manavata ni Mahek Cheritable trust. He was the wellknown business lead and socialist in Surat. till now he had participate into many social works. experiences. His skills involve fundraising and Management. He is with vast experience in working with various Non-profit groups in Gujarat.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>Initially, we were taking a look at animal activities and after that we were realised that the current sitution of the voiceless animal was not so good so that for helping animal we started MNM - Manavata ni mahek Cheritable Trust -- Non Profit Organization (NGO). We took permission from state gorvnment and our registration no is E/8911/SURAT. we do not know how many more years we could have waited to help the animals and people of Ranchi.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We give free treatment to the voiceless animals, providing shelter for loyal friends of human. We provided our NGO's helpline number which works for 24x7. After receiving call our team reach that place ASAP and give them proper treatment.not only this we also do other social work like blood donation camp, help the poor, Shal vintaran etc.</p>
